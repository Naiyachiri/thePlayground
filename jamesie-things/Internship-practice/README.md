# Internship Practice

The purpose of this folder and contents is to give me a sub repository of subject matter I am working on relating to my summer internship of 2019

## WIP

1. understanding maven builder
    - I dont understand the classpath error, which is likely responsible for maven being unable to detect the tests
2. class path issue
    - begin taking a tutorial on java
        - goal: finish code academy java tutorial (or elsewhere if codeacademy hasn't )


## Focus Contents

1.  Building out a RESTful API with Tomcat and Java
    - understand mechanics of running tomcat and deploying .war files(ROOT.war)
    - using Maven(mvn) as a build tool
    - javax.wr.rs API usage for REST
    - understanding basic RESTful concepts (your resources, HTTP verbs/actions for creation, deletion, and updating them)
    - getting used to Java and the TestUnit framework
    - testing your API using something like Postman

2. Build out an app using react like in the ReactJS tutorial (I have already done this once, but I think a review is in order)
