    <h1> So it begins... A blogger who tells his story about growing and doing what he likes </h1>
    <h3> <time datetime="2018-03-09"> March 9, 2018 </time></h3>
    <p> So today is a corner stone in my life of trying to figure out what I want and like to do. I have always had an
        upbringing in which I tend to follow the guidelines and desires of my elders. Be a doctor, make money to help
        the family, work, work, work... Rare was the idea of what one likes or is interested ever explored in the
        household. </p>
    <p> Reflecting upon my life, <em>"Have I lived my own life or just spent it trying to please everyone." </em> is
        what bobs in my mind like a buoy. Its funny how our minds are geared to seeing patterns and correlations. </p>
