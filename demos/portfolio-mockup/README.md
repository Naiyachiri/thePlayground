# Porfolio Mockup

This is my submission for project 1 of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Specifications

### Required Elements

* At least 4 images
* title text (`h1`,`h2`,`h3`, etc...)
* regular paragraph text
* a logo

### Required Semantics

* HTML5 (`<header>`,`<footer>`,`<article>`,`<section>`, etc)
* all `div` or `section` have a class or id

### Custom Design

#### Do atleast one of the following

* Customize imgages and text
* Customize placement of elements on the page with `html` and/or `css`
* Customize `css` applies at minimum to paragraph and heading elements

### Grid-Based Layout

* Use either `flexbox`, `Bootstrap`, `Foundation`, or other css framework in order to generate a grid layout on the mockup

## Responsive Design

### Cross-device Compatibility

* Content must render well on test devices : Google Nexus 5, Apple iPad and Desktop
* All content must be rendered on the three devices, no content should be hidden
* `<meta name="viewport"...>` must be included
* images should be responsive using `css` or media-queries

## Organization

* Porfolio should have separated `html` and `css` _no style elements in the document_
* directory structure should be based on functionality (ie: `css/`, `img/`, `js/`, etc).

## Quality of Code

* All `HTML` is lowercase except `text/CDATA`
* Code does not have trailing white spaces
* Indentation is consistent (either all tabs, 2 spaces, or 4 spaces, etc)
* Code uses a new line for every block, list, or table element and indent every such child element
* Quoted attribute values uses double quotation marks
* `HTML` templates and documents use `UTF-8` encoding
* todo lists are marked with `TODO`

### CSS Specific formating Rules

* Indents all block content
* Semicolon present after every declaration for consistency and extensibility
* Code always uses a space after a property name's colon but no space between property and colon
* Code always uses a single space between last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block
* New line for each selector and declaration
* Always have a blank line (two line breaks) between rules
* Code uses double quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values. Do not use quotation marks in `URI` values (`url()`)
* Code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are asshort and succinct as necessary
* Element names are not used in conjunction with IDs or classes
* Shorthand is used whenever possible
* Unit values are omited after 0 values
* Leading 0 before decimal values for readibility
* Uses 3 char hexadecimal notation where possible (ie `#fff`)
* Code separates words in ID and class names by `-`
* Code avoids user agent detection

## TODO

* use scrollify to scroll page for us
* back to top button
* make navbar fixed in larger resolutions
* follow Buttons for Github, codepen, linkin
