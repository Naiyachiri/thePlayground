You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

With the four lessons covered so far, I have learned the basic boiler plate html to create a website and how to represent
the data structure as similar to a pedigree chart in biology. I have also learned to better use pyCharm for my needs in this class.
The most novel thing so far in my studies since I have some prior experience with html, is the <figure> tags and the figcaptions.

I think so far most of the topics have been very easy. The ability to search up how to do things on the internet is a key skill
and at the same time the most difficult part of the exercises as wording becomes crucial to finding the correct or best solution
to your problem.

The first project has shown me the truth in one of the earlier videos that a significant portion of our development careers will be
referencing other sources on how to do things and the idea that every problem has more than one solution. In this way, I actively
search for solutions from many different sources in order expand my techniques as well as gain greater understanding of
the tools I am using.
